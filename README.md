Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) on Cab Booking App Reviews
This project implements a complete pipeline for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis using deep learning models on real-world customer reviews of a cab booking application. It enables fine-grained opinion mining on various aspects mentioned in the reviews and provides sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral) per aspect.

The project also includes a Streamlit-based frontend to visualize and interact with the results.

üîç Project Overview
Traditional sentiment analysis provides only a single polarity (positive/negative) per review. However, a review may contain multiple aspects (e.g., driver behavior, app interface, pricing) with different sentiments. This project aims to detect such aspects and determine sentiment polarity for each one, allowing businesses to gain deeper insights from customer feedback.
